# Water Dam Report
### Background and Purpose of the project:
California's water crisis is well known among the states. Espacially, California often experiences the extreme drought. It is hard to solve it because there are many factors contributing to it. Right now, given our current California wet winter and the recent Orovill Dame emergency, how to better to manage the dam?
<br>[Current California state water status data can be found here](http://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=RES)
<br>To be able to manage Dam's water, we need to know:
1. Is it filling, draining or holding steady?
2. How full is it right now (in %)?
3. What happens to the dam status if we import or release a lot of water?
4. What happens to the dam status if we increase or decrease the water outflow?
5. At current net inflow/outflow, on what calendar day will "dam event" happen? (dam events means either the dam fills completely or empties completely)

I use Java to create a user interface program to report California water dam’s health status

### What does it do:
1. It does data checking to ensure validity of data and derives data accessors to calculate the data 
2. It will create a report that includes the year of the dam, the amount of water flows in and water flows out, the net difference between the two, the capacity of the dam and current storage amount.
3. To let user be able to manage the Dam’s water, the program shows the predicted dam status under the situations where importing or releasing the water and increasing or decreasing the water outflow.
