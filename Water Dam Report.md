# Water Dam Report
Background and Purpose of the project:

I use Java to create a user interface program to report California water dam’s health status
## What does it do:
1. It does data checking to ensure validity of data and derives data accessors to calculate the data 
2. It will create a report that includes the year of the dam, the amount of water flows in and water flows out, the net difference between the two, the capacity of the dam and current storage amount.
3. To let user be able to manage the Dam’s water, the program shows the predicted dam status under the situations where importing or releasing the water and increasing or decreasing the water outflow.
