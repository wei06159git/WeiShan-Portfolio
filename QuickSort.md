# QuickSort
## Introduction: 
Quicksort is often the best pratical choice for sorting because its average running time is O(nlogn). In addition, it works well in virtual-memory environments. In here, I designed Quicksort algorithm with 2 kinds of partition.
<br>First type of partition: It always chooses the last element in the array as pivot to partition the subarray.
<br>Second type of partition (Median-of-three partition): It chooses the median value amongst array a[start], a[middle], a[end] as the pivot. </br>
