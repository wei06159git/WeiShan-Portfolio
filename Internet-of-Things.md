<h1>Internet of Things (IoT)</h1>
<p>The concept for Internet of Things is connecting any device via Internet. People and devices can interact with each other, share and collect data through the Internet in a distance. In this unit, I learned to use MicroPython with micro:bit microcontroller to create my own functional device. In addition, I explored different ways to connect my own device to other devices such as iPhone and another microcontrollers in a distance. This involves using radio module and bluetooth.</p>
<p>Below is my MicroPython project. I created a device that uses temperature sensor to detect the surrounding temperature and then displays different color on the RGB LED. </p>
