<h1>Fundamentals of Programming in Python</h1>
  <p>In this unit, I have learned the fundamentals of python programming. With those skills and knowledge, I can write some simple but meaningful programs. The skills and knowledge I learned are listed below.üëá</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li><b>Iteration and Conditional Execution</b></li>
  <t>I am able to differentiate between the forms and uses of iterative and conditional execution constructs. In addition, I have developed Python logic, using iteration and conditional statements, to interrogate and modify data contained in lists and dictionaries.</t>
  <ol><li>Scissors-Paper-rock Game</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
      <li><a href="https://github.com/wei06159git/WeiShan-Portfolio/blob/master/rockpaperscissors.py">Human vs. Computer</a></li>
      <p>In this game, I created a game that human can play against the computer. In order to create a computer role, I imported random module to randomly generate scissors, paper or rock. Then, to know who wins, I utilized conditional statements(if-elif-else) to list all the situations and write out the expected results for each situation. If human enters something irrelevant, the program will give a message said "Invalid Input" and ask user to enter again. In addition, I made this a three round game so that I used while loop to make whole conditional statements run three times.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/wei06159git/WeiShan-Portfolio/blob/master/rock-paper-scissors.py">Human vs. Human</a></li>
      <p>In this game, I created a game that human play against human. I utilized the similar conditional statements mentioned above to determine who wins. The special thing about this program is that I imported stdiomask which will convert user input into '*'. By doing this way, no way can see other people's typing. </p>
    </ul>
    <li><a href = "https://github.com/wei06159git/WeiShan-Portfolio/blob/master/Sun-PasswordManager.py">Password Manager Project</a></li>
  </ol>
  <li><b>Functions</b></li>
  <t>I understand the syntax of the python functions and know how to create one to perform meaningful task.</t>
    <ol><li><a href = "https://github.com/wei06159git/WeiShan-Portfolio/blob/master/Sun-EncryptionProject.py">Encryption Project</a></li>
    <li><a href ="https://github.com/wei06159git/WeiShan-Portfolio/blob/master/Sun-PasswordManager.py">Password Manager Project</a></li>
  </ol>
  <li><b>Lists and Dictionaries</b></li>
  <t>I can identify the different characteristics and uses of Python lists and dictionaries, and understand how to apply it to the codes.</t>
    <ol><li><a href = "https://github.com/wei06159git/WeiShan-Portfolio/blob/master/Sun-PictureGrid.py">Picture Grid</a></li>
      <p>In this program, I created a 2 dimensional list to draw a cat.üê±</p>
  </ol>
  <li><b>String Methods and Exception Handling</b></li>
  <t>I learned the string methods to format the string or text. Besides of that, I have studied how to utilize the "try-except" to handle the error.</t>
  <ol><li><a href="https://github.com/wei06159git/WeiShan-Portfolio/blob/master/b_methods.py">String Methods</a></li> </ol>
  <li><b>File Input/Output</b></li>
  <t>I have ability to produce python codes to read from existed file, edit the existed file and write to a new file. </t>
  <ol>
    <li>Favorite Number Project</li>
    <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/wei06159git/WeiShan-Portfolio/blob/master/Sun-FavoriteNumbers-1.py">Read in file and search for the user's request</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/wei06159git/WeiShan-Portfolio/blob/master/Sun-FavoriteNumbers.py">Write into the files and edit</a></li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
</ul>
