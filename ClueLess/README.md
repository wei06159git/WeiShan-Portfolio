## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

After running through prerequisites, clone the project into your workspace using git. 

Please do not hesitate to contact the Team for help with getting your environment setup.

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisite software must be installed on your development machine. 
The libGDX Gradle Setup app can help you configure your project.

IMPORTANT - Java SDK downgraded to version 11 as Java 13 still has many issues as it's fairly new this year in 2019.


* Java Software Development Kit 11 ([IntelliJ has a plugin to help select the JDK to use](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544879-Selecting-the-JDK-version-the-IDE-will-run-under?page=3))

* [libGDX Gradle based Setup App](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html)
* [Gradle Version 5.0](https://gradle.org/) - No download necessary, the following IDE's can download it for you once project is set up.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Content tracker used to upload code to Bitbucket. 
* [Skin Composer](https://github.com/raeleus/skin-composer/releases/) - LibGDX UI tool for composing skins and widgets
To grab this repo, open a terminal on your system and perform the following commands.
